# Part 1 — Theoretical Analysis

## Q1: How Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy (with real-world example)
(Answer written in the assignment submission — condensed for GitHub.)

**Edge AI** performs inference on the device (edge), reducing round-trip latency to cloud servers and keeping raw data local, which improves privacy.
Example: Autonomous drones perform obstacle detection on-device to avoid crashes in low-connectivity environments.

## Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI — Optimization Problems + Benefiting Industries
(Answer written in the assignment submission — condensed for GitHub.)

Classical AI uses heuristics and gradient-based methods; Quantum AI leverages superposition, entanglement and tunnelling to explore large solution spaces faster. Industries: logistics, finance, pharma, energy, manufacturing.
